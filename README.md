Object Orientated Programming Assignment

A first year programming assignment to create a music player that stores music files as objects.

This is our teams finished project.

However the purpose of the assignment was to show how well we understood classes and objects to make a mock-up music player we felt as if 
it would be advantageous to learn how music players worked since it was one of the first things we used in our early computing days playing the preloaded 
songs on Windows

We are going to extend the program to include
- a gui
- option for entering the file system address of a song, C:\mark\home\music\song.mp3
- file browser !?! more advanced unless I can port one from open source software.
- Music Player API
